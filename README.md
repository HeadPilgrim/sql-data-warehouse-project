# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.

---

## 🏛️ Data Architecture

This project implements the **Medallion Architecture**, a layered approach to organizing data in a data lake or warehouse. The architecture is divided into three main layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw, unprocessed data ingested from various sources.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data, optimized for analytics and reporting.
- **Gold Layer**: Aggregated, business-level data ready for advanced analytics and machine learning.

This structure ensures data quality, scalability, and efficient data processing.
